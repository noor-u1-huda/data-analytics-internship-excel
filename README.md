# Data Analytics Internship – Excel Projects

This repository contains the work I have completed during my Data Analytics Internship, focused on practical data analysis using Microsoft Excel for a real client case: **Sprocket Central Pty Ltd**.

---

## Overview

During this internship, I worked on analyzing customer and transaction datasets to support marketing strategy and business growth. The work primarily involved:

- Assessing data quality and identifying issues that could impact analysis  
- Designing an analytical approach to target high-value customers  
- Creating dashboards to visualize insights and support decision-making  

All analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, complemented by presentations and reports created as PDFs.
